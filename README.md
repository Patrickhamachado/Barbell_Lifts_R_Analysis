# Barbell Lifts R Analysis

---

This repo is intended to complete the Prediction Assignment Writeup, of the fourth week of the [Coursera Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning/peer/R43St/prediction-assignment-writeup) course.

The code with all the analysis is in the **Barbell_Lifts_R_Analysis.Rmd** and  **Barbell_Lifts_R_Analysis.html** files. Also, [the HTML page can be viewed here](https://patrickhamachado.github.io/Barbell_Lifts_R_Analysis/Barbell_Lifts_R_Analysis.html)

## How well they do Barbell Lifts?

## A. Course Project Instructions

### Background

Using devices such as *Jawbone Up*, *Nike FuelBand*, and *Fitbit* it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify *how well they do it*. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har> (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).
